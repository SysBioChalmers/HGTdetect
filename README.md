# HGTdetect
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the exchange of genetic material
between disparate groups of organisms other than from parent to offspring,
which has been confirmed as a very significant factor in adaptive
evolution, disease emergence and metabolic shift that can act across various
species. However, current methods for HGT detection are usually not automatic,
narrow applicable or unavailable to use. In this work, we developed a versatile computational
toolbox named HGTdetect by combining a high-throughput pipeline together with phylogenetic analysis
to facilitate comprehensive investigation of the potential mechanism for HGT events. Tests on two case
studies suggest that this approach could effectively
identify horizontally acquired genes of high accuracy. In-depth phylogenetic analysis further facilitates
the navigation of the potential donors and detailed gene transmission process. The HGTdetect toolbox
is designed for ease of use and could accurately find HGT events with a very low false discovery rate
in a high-throughput manner.
